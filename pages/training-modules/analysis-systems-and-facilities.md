# Data Analysis Systems and Facilities training module

Data analysis frameworks for HEP software are often built by the
physicists. Currently several C++-based frameworks, often controlled
by Python, are in use. The frameworks are also integrated closely
with data formats used for archival, for example [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch). 
Newer frameworks in the Python ecosystem, e.g. [Scikit-HEP](https://scikit-hep.org),
are also being developed which leverage developments in the larger data 
science ecosystem. HEP students & postdocs are often familiar with using
these tools, but typically know little about how they work under the hood.
This training module will review the evolving HEP analysis ecosystem, 
including the performance and I/O limitations and tradeoffs as well as newer 
strategies, e.g., columnar data analysis, and implications for designing
modern analysis facilities. The goal of the module will be 
to prepare the students to develop scalable, performant and innovative
tools within the ecosystem.
