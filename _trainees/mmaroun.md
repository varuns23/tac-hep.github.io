### Biography and Interests

I am a third-year graduate students interested in Higgs physics and in software for data analysis in HEP. I've been involved in the validation and training of the new _CP Algorithms_ tools, which is the new standard ATLAS software for application of calibration corrections and systematic variations in analysis frameworks. More recently, I started developing a experiment-independent project with the ROOT team for the implementation of Neural Simulation-Based Inference in RooFit and to address the more general challenges of creating Asimov (expected) results in unbinned analyses.

### Project 

- Implementation of _CP Algorithms_ in ATLAS analysis frameworks
- Text-based configuration for _CP Algorithms_-based analysis frameworks
- Software infrastructure for neural simulation-based inference in ROOT
- Tools for Asimov construction in unbinned analyses

### Recent Accomplishments

- Performed numerical validation of the _CP Algorithms_ tools
- Tutorial lectures on the usage of the _CP Algorithms_ tools
- Implementation of Neural Simulation-Based Inference analysis in RooFit

### Mentors

- Verena Martinez Outschoorn (UMass)
- Rafael Coelho Lopes de Sa (UMass)
