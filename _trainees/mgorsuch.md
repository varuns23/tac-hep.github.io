### Biography and Interests

I am a third year graduate student working in the Observational Cosmology group at University of Wisconsin - Madison.

### Project

I am contributing to the development and testing of novel algorithms
for combining multiple optical/near-IR pixel-level images in the
same region of the sky to make robust, high signal-to-noise
measurements of faint galaxies for weak gravitational lensing and
galaxy clustering probes of dark energy with the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Specifically,
I am working on the implementation of the cell-based (or “edgeless”)
image coaddition algorithm in the LSST Science Pipelines. Cell-based
coadds are substantially more computationally efficient when working
with large numbers of overlapping images and enable more robust
modeling of the point-spread function (PSF). The approach will be
tested and optimized for computational and science performance on
increasingly large datasets until it is validated for deployment
on survey-scale LSST data release processing.

### Recent Accomplishments
- Developed collection of testing analyses for cell-based coadds (in progress) [GitHub link](https://github.com/mirarenee/notebooks/blob/main/cell_coadds/cell_coadd_sandbox.ipynb)
- Developed an introductory notebook for cell-based coadds (in progress) [GitHub link](https://github.com/mirarenee/notebooks/blob/main/cell_coadds/cell_coadd_intros.ipynb)
- Aided in testing image warping and coaddition tasks within LSST Science Pipelines
