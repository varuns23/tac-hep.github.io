### Biography
I am a fifth-year graduate student in the Princeton University CMS experiment group advised by Prof. Isobel Ojalvo. I am currently based in Geneva at CERN. 

Formerly I was an undergraduate at Caltech, and was supported by the NSF GRFP during part of my graduate program.

### Project interests
My current projects include a search for new physics (exotic Higgs decays to pseudoscalars to two b-quarks and two tau leptons), and developing improved high-granularity algorithms for reconstructing electrons and photons in the Level-1 Trigger of the CMS Experiment for the Phase 2 High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. 

I am interested in learning how advances in computing techniques and tools can be harnessed to meet the demands and enhance the capabilities of current and future physics experiments.
