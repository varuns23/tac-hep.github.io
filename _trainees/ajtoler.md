### Biography and Interests
 
I am a third year graduate student currently progressing towards a PhD at the UMass Amherst on the ATLAS Experiment. 

### Project 
I am contributing to the L0MDT effort within the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, specifically studying firmware design performance via simulations. To do this I study the impact of inefficiencies within the detector and implement updates to the logic that can improve the robustness of the MS trigger. So far multiple performance studies have been created with ongoing effort to implement Hough transforms to compensate for subdetector inefficiencies

### Recent Accomplishments
  * Passed written component of doctoral qualifying

### Mentors 
  * Davide Cieri (Max Planck Institute for Physics)
  * Carlo Dallapiccola (University of Massachusetts Amherst)
  * Verena Martinez Outschoorn (University of Massachusetts)
  * St√©phane Willocq (University of Massachusetts Amherst)
