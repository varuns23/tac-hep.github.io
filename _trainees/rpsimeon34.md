### Biography and Interests

I am a second-year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, working in the CMS group and advised by Professor Sridhara Dasu.

### Project

I am contributing to the Analysis Facilities effort within USCMS computing working with Fermilab scientists Dr. Lindsey Gray and Dr. Nick Smith. I am developing tools that make it easier for physicists to harness large amounts of computing power and big data for scientific analyses. In particular, I am working on a JupyterLab interface and built-in Python package that presents users with an environment pre-configured for modern Python-based data analysis and high throughput computing at our particular Analysis Facility.
The work involves integrating with the CMS Tier-2 at UW-Madison and the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) resources. This includes developing a [repository of example and tutorial code](https://github.com/rpsimeon34/wisc-af-examples) that guides users from first interaction with contemporary High Energy Physics packages to performing data analysis on a computing cluster. I am also making contributions to various packages deployed at Analysis Facilities, including improving remote data access with [fsspec-xrootd](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/fsspec-xrootd) and developing documentation for [coffea](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea).

### Recent Accomplishments

- Created a [repository of annotated examples](https://github.com/rpsimeon34/wisc-af-examples) for using the Analysis Facility
- Created the [cowtools](https://github.com/rpsimeon34/cowtools) package for off-the-shelf distributed computing tools for our particular Analysis Facility
