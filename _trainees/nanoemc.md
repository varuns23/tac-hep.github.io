### Biography and Interests

I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working on a PhD in High Energy Experimental Particle Physics with the CMS experiment. I hope to transition into Research Software Engineering as my career once I finish. Through TAC-HEP I have found that my main interest is supporting science through software development. My other interests include knitting, photography, cooking and baking, video games, board games, and hiking.

### Project

I currently work on the Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF) hosted at Fermilab. It is part of the R&D effort to develop high performing analysis tools that we can use for HL-LHC and generally for other future experiments. Specifically I work on developing the Dask setup and system that integrates with Fermilab’s HTCondor system. I hope to improve the way we use Dask so that we can sustain and support many users in an easy to implement way. Other tasks I work on are benchmarking for the EAF, acting as a liaison between the EAF and IRIS-HEP, and I generally aid and support as a member of the EAF applications team. 

### Recent Accomplishments
- [EAF White Paper for the European Strategy for Particle Physics – 2026 update](https://indico.global/event/14242/contributions/122934/attachments/57645/110741/EAF_Whitepaper_for_EU_Particle_Physics_Strategy_Update.pdf)
- [US CMS Analysis Facility Meeting Talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1478327/contributions/6227144/attachments/2965981/5218145/AGC%20Benchmarks%20at%20EAF.pdf) documenting benchmarking efforts for the EAF through the AGC
- [Added features to dask set-up (HTCdaskgateway)](https://github.com/mapsacosta/htcdaskgateway), like user ability to specify worker images
- Updated [Documentation](https://eafdocs.fnal.gov/02_batch_dask_cms.html) for dask set-up (HTCdaskgateway) NOTE: Fermilab service accounts are now required for documentation access
- [Demonstration Video of the EAF](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1291680/contributions/5581053/attachments/2714147/4713730/EAF_Demo_Video_with_audio.mp4) - Combination of the work described, produced for the AGC Demonstration Day
- Successfully adapted AGC Notebook to EAF
