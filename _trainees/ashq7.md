### Biography
I am a second-year PhD student in the CMS group at Princeton University working with Professor Isobel Ojalvo. I joined the TAC-HEP project in the spring. During this time I took Introduction to programming systems at Princeton which includes modular programming, advanced program design, programming style, test, debugging and performance tuning; machine languages and assembly language; and use of system call services. This is my first summer with the TAC-HEP project. 

### Project interests
I am  working on Phase 2 L1 Calorimeter Trigger upgrades, algorithms and Fast-Machine Learning.
