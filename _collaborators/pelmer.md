### Biography

Peter Elmer is an experimental particle physicist whose area of
expertise is developing the software and computing systems needed
to operate and produce scientific results from data-intensive high
energy physics experiments. His current research focuses on the
[Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](https://cms.cern) experiment at the
[Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) at the
[European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)](http://home.web.cern.ch/). In the past he has worked on the
[ALEPH experiment](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/experiments/aleph)
at CERN and the 
[BaBar experiment](http://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/babar/) at the
[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/).
He is the Executive Director and Principal Investigator for the NSF-funded 
[Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](http://iris-hep.org/).

He received a Ph.D. in Experimental High Energy Physics from the
University of Wisconsin - Madison and is a Senior Research Physicist
at Princeton University.

### Project interests

His research group at Princeton is involved in developing tools and
systems for data analysis as well as innovative algorithms for the
trigger and reconstruction in the CMS experiment at the LHC. The
group is also a major contributor to the development of training
materials and activities to support research software in particle
physics.  He research interests also include the structures and
processes for developing international distributed research software
collaborations.
